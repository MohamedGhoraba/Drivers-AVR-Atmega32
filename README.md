  1. I2C
  2. SPI
  3. UART
  4. ADC
  5. Keypad
  6. LCD
  7. EEPROM

### Helpful Files:
  1. `Common_Macros.h`: It has common macros that help to build drivers and applications more easily ex: Set_Bit....etc.
  2. `Micro_Config.h`: It has configuration for Microcontroller Atmega32.
  3. `Std_Types.h`: It has standard data types to make it clearer ex: Uint8...etc.
